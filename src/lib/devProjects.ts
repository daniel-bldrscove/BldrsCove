				'Build Beautiful Spaces is a small business that specializes in restoration and interior renovation. \n \n Lacking an online presence, the project consisted of developing a user friendly website that would not sacrifice on speed due to its image-heavy content. For this reason, I decided on Gatsbyâ€™s SSG build, and implemented caching and lazy loading. \n \n Integrating pagination for the main work page also made sense from a performance and UX standpoint. The file upload and email integrations leverage 3rd party APIs, which makes the contact user experience easy and help prevent bot submissions.',

This is where Trading Ally helps distill noisy data into a simple and clear UI. \n\n Although still in development, Trading Ally seeks to help users answer three simple questions. \n\n - "What was my past trading performance?" \n - "What is my current trading performance?" \n - "Where do I want my future trading performance to be?" \n\n Trading Ally empowers it\'s users by giving them control over their own data and provides suggestions that can help investors achieve their goals.',
