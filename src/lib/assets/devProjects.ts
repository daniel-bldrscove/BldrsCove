			'Build Beautiful Spaces is a small business that specializes in restoration and interior renovation. \n \n Lacking an online presence, the project consisted of developing a user friendly website that would not sacrifice on speed due to its image-heavy content. For this reason, I decided on Gatsbyâ€™s SSG build, and implemented caching and lazy loading. \n \n Integrating pagination for the main work page also made sense from a performance and UX standpoint. The file upload and email integrations leverage 3rd party APIs, which makes the contact user experience easy and help prevent bot submissions.',
